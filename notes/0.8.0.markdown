* Major changes:
  - #47: Translated all settings-modules to [auto-plugins](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Plugins.html) with proper dependencies between them. They will be [enabled](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Using-Plugins.html#Enabling+and+disabling+auto+plugins) automatically, so you can disable some of them explicitly if needed. Plugins that need to be ebaled explicitly:
    + The one for Java-only projects: add `enablePlugins(JavaOnlySettings)` to enable it
    + #39: New `StatikaBundleSettings` plugin, which adds dependency on Statika (version is configurable with `statikaVersion`) and uses [sbt-buildinfo](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-buildinfo) to generate the artifact metadata for statika bundles. Add `enablePlugins(StatikaBundleSettings)` to enable it.
  - #45: The new `AssemblySettings` auto-plugin loads fat-jar related settings automatically, but to publish the generated artifact, you need to add `addFatArtifactPublishing(<config>)` setting to your `build.sbt` explicitly (default `<config>` is `Compile`).
  - #35: The new `VersionSettings` auto-plugin sets `version` setting based on `git describe` and provides a `gitVersion` setting returning `Version` type.
  - #49: Release part was completely reworked and rewritten without using sbt-release. The new `release` command provides tab-completion for available release versions you can do from the current `gitVersion`. This makes it much easier to make releases without handling versions manually.
